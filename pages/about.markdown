title: "About Me"
---

Graduated Northeastern University 2018.

I'm a programmer by training (and by trade), but I'm a bit of a nerd about everything.
For instance, I've written scripts[^2] to download every Congressional Research Service report[^3] and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, not to mention the time I've taken reading Supreme Court opinions and research papers on everything from mass incarceration to single-atom transistors.
I devour books voraciously; most, if not all, of my downtime is devoted to learning about wildly varying subjects, anything that I don't know, I must know.

<q>Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.</q>[^1]
I get that Judge Holden is a pretty terrible character, and it's telling about me that I would compare myself to him.
But, that quote resonates with me to a chilling extent.
