So I was reading Oliver North's Wikipedia page, as one does, and I learned that he lives in McLean, Virginia---where I work.
Weird.

In my experience, which is somewhat limited, it's not to difficult a thing to **not dress in blackface**.
Maybe I had wildly different college and/or young adult experiences than these Virginia politicians---I mean I probably did---but I haven't ever even known anybody who'd even alluded to thinking about it.[^4]

I find it rather enjoyable to see a person as odious as Kris Kobach get relentlessly owned, over and over again.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.bourdain %}
Much has been said about Anthony Bourdain, but it's interesting to hear from the people who knew him best.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.chess %}
I'll admit that I saw/read this article only because I was familiar with the author.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.irs %}
I really like this piece,[^3] it, aside from being well written, made me think about how under appreciated an agency the I.R.S. is.
It's such an easy enemy, cause who likes the I.R.S.?
Nobody wants to be that senator or representative, the one who really wants to make sure that everybody follows the rules.

Also, I read a book written by one of the authors, _The Chickenshit Club_, and it was really good.

Uh, so this one seems---to me at least---rather out of place.
Just some celebrity gossip type junk; just some pop culture pap.[^1]

I don't really care, or think, about Nick Jonas all that often; I'll pause here to let that revelation sink in.

...

Priyanka Chopra, on the other hand, is someone who I have thought about in my life.[^2]
I'm pretty sure that I watched most of the first season of _Quantico_.
I don't really know where I was originally going with this..., anyways, enjoyed the article.

[^1]: Not that there's anything wrong with pop culture generally. Or anything wrong with pap.
[^2]: I know that sounded pretty creepy, bear with me.
[^3]: That should probably be self-evident, I guess.
[^4]: Wrote that paragraph like three weeks ago, when this was relevant.
