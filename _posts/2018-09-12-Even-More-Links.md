A bit old, but I never tire of a little Elon bashing.
I almost can't believe that he is still in charge of Tesla; what does the board know that we don't?

I'm obviously not supportive of heavy-handed meddling in primaries,[^1] like what the DNC did to Bernie,[^2] and I'm skeptical of the thesis this article puts forth, i.e., that parties should be strong in order to shield us, the uninformed masses, from potential Donald Trumps,[^3] but I still found this interesting.
Even assuming that a more powerful RNC could have stopped Trump in 2015/16, I find myself convinced that they still would have been unable to stop the rightward, nationalistic trend that Trump represents.

It's appropriate that the most prominent lawyer for the most unhinged President in American history is phenomenally unhinged.
I mean, who else could defend a man such as Donald Trump in public?

Rudy's transformation into his current incarnation is quite the journey.
Right after 9/11, his approval was through the dang roof, he could have been elected president,[^6] if an election was held in an off year and during September.
He was "America's Mayor," now he's some stooge with his literal foot in his mouth on cable news, like up to and often past the ankle.
When he spoke at the 2016 RNC, I was like, "this is as crazy as he'll ever be, this is his final form," I apparently underestimated the level of insane a human being could achieve.
I mean, at the time I was pretty sure that literally Donald Trump[^4] couldn't be elected President of the United States.

Boy was I wrong.

{% include link.html title="State Accidentally Abolishes 'American Rule' for Attorneys' Fees" link=oklink author="Joe Patrice" %}
I found this vaguely hilarious, but also obviously horrifying.
Like, how is it possible that nobody read the bill?
Or, had they read the bill, how did they not realize the ramifications?

Scary stuff.

Like, how could a university police force or school district possibly need assault rifles or grenade launchers or mine-resistant vehicles?[^5]

There's something to be said here regarding the inflation of defense spending, including bipartisan unwillingness to reduce current levels of spending.
After 9/11,[^7] we were all scared, a decidedly understandable, almost rational reaction, so we jumped into a war or two and started throwing cash at the Department of Defense.
It's been seventeen years since then, we need to reevaluate our priorities; we all got distracted by the threat of international terror and lost touch with the fact that there are significant portions of the population that are neglected or outright antagonized by our government.
Giving military grade weapons and equipment to local police forces isn't making anyone safer, not the officers and certainly not those they are sworn to protect.
Instead of throwing another half-a-trillion dollars into the next F-35 size debacle, maybe we can use that money to, I don't know, make sure Social Security is funded, pay for Medicare for All, or make a payment on the unfathomable debt we owe to African-Americans.

[^1]: And I'm sure the majority of Democrats would agree.
[^2]: Although I don't accept the conclusion that he would have received the Democratic nomination if they didn't help Hillary.
[^3]: Or would it be Donalds Trump?
[^4]: Like, the guy from "The Apprentice," the dude who fired celebrities (as well as normals) for sucking at business.
[^5]: To be fair, the Los Angeles school district returned the grenade launchers and the mine-resistant vehicle, but they kept the 60-plus M-16s (which they definitely don't need).
[^6]: I mean, looking at his past statements and actions, it's pretty clear that he's always loved the spotlight, been pretty racist, and generally had a bit of a screw loose
[^7]: Which, I'm actually writing this sentence on 9/11/2018.
