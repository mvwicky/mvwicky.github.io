There are so many phrases and words that I'd like to work into my day-to-day, but just the thought of saying them aloud, like _to another human being_, seems so unnatural.
For instance, I'd like to use the word "perforce" more in conversation.
It's a word that just sounds nice, and I always feel like it'll be so much more applicable than it ever is.

"Good looking out," to showcase another example, is great, but always feels so out of place w.r.t. my normal speaking patterns.

It was weird to see this so close (temporally) to Christine Blasey Ford's testimony,[^1] but it's not related at all really to that.
