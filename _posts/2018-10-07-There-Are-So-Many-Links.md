I'm worried about the fact that the time between these posts is growing precipitously.
I mean, it's an obvious artifact of the fact that I have a job right now, but, it's still a bit troubling.

The proportion of the short, short time I have on Earth I've spent telling people about how great [Dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com) is at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dictionarycom), is likely abnormal.[^1]

I first read, first heard of, Rebecca Solnit in the photography class I took my last semester of college.
In that instance, we read excerpts from an acclaimed book of hers in which she examines the life (and photographs) of Eadweard Muybridge,[^2] a man who photographs of the American West before American interlopers got their hands on it[^5] and took some [pictures of horses.](http://100photos.time.com/photos/eadweard-muybridge-horse-in-motion)[^3]
Anyways, that digression[^4] was basically a brag letting you know that I had heard of the writer to whom I am linking you now.

It's a great read, well, to be fair, it's not great, it's rough and hard to read at times, but it is certainly important.[^6]

[^1]: To say the least.
[^2]: A name which is frightfully difficult to know if spelled correctly, as all computers will insist that you're wrong, but I got it right (though I had to check).
[^3]: Solnit, Rebecca. <cite>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West.</cite> Viking, 2003.
[^4]: I feel weird using that word since trying to use it in a title of a book.
[^5]: Which, incidentally, along with similar representations of the West as pristine and untouched, really helped convince Americans to migrate westward and kill all the Native Americans which they found already living there.
[^6]: There's a whole different discussion there about how to use positive sounding adjectives with respect to things that are downers.
