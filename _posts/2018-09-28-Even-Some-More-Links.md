Some of these links are pretty old, relative to the way that news just zooms on by in this day and age.
For instance, _The Case for Reparations_ is actually old, from like seven years ago, but the Philippines one is old in the way that Facebook and its scandals are basically out of the zeitgeist.
I mean, it's not like Facebook is irrelevant, it's continuously relevant, but we're not all constantly talking about it the way we were like three weeks ago.

It's pretty much the same case with the Nike letter by the National Black Police Association.[^2]
I'd attribute this "problem"[^3] to the fact that I find articles continuously, and because I try to write these posts some time in advance.

I'd like to take this opportunity to link an article whose headline amused me.
The article is from Reuters and is titled <a href="{{ page.links.peru }}">"In Peru, Hitler runs for mayor despite threat from Lennin."</a>
I don't have much more to say about it than, "read the title," but there's an interesting tidbit in there about how in a lot of Latin American countries, parents name their kids something foreign that sounds interesting.
It's remarkable how things that seem completely universal in the US/the "West" generally, like Hitler being a symbol of complete and utter evil, are not, in fact universal.

This is a long one,[^1] but well worth the effort.

I've found Rodrigo Duterte pretty disgusting for a while, and this only confirmed my preexisting notions about him.
{% include todo.html msg="more about Duterte; also Facebook" %}

This seems like a decent opportunity to reiterate my theory regarding _Buzzfeed News_, which is the source of some truly great reporting these days.
My theory, or my hypotheses on their future,[^4] is that at some point, they will be bought by someone or spun off in some way or at the very least rebranded.
Like I said, they're good at what they do, and they have some incredible reporters there; I'm just skeptical they can attract a base of readers when the first thing that pops into mind when I think of them is a quiz telling me which character from _Friends_ I am.[^5]

[^1]: It took me like three full days to actually read it.
[^2]: I.e., we're not all thinking about Colin Kaepernick 24/7 like we were just a week or so ago.
[^3]: I don't really think it's that big of a gd deal.
[^4]: To be more accurate, but quite a bit wordier.
[^5]: For the record, I like to think of myself as a Chandler, but I get that the more likely reality is that I'm a Ross. Which is just really unfortunate. Cause that guy kinda sucks.
