{% include link.html title="Vintage John McCain: Dead at 81, He Was America's Senator, Not Arizona's" link="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/john-mccain-america-senator-arizona-obituary-10001670" author="Amy Silverman" %}
I first came across this article with the note "if you're not into hagiography \[read this article on John McCain\]."
It does a fine job showing McCain as a human being, not the deity that national media outlets have been presenting in the last few days.
I'd say that it may be a bit biased towards showing some negative aspects of McCain, but Silverman doesn't go out of her way to bash and/or disrespect McCain needlessly (plus, with the level of public adulation/canonization going on, it's fine to have the other side as well).

{% include link.html title="Beto O'Rourke Could Be The Democrat Texas Has Been Waiting For" link="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-texas-senate-midterms" author="Anne Helen Petersen" %}
I'll admit from the outset that I'm more than a little obsessed with Beto O'Rourke.
He, like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, seems to be the rare politician that is comfortable also being a human being.
[His response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAw9eXXVwfM) to a question regarding the NFL kneelers has really catapulted him into the limelight, but since the beginning of his campaign he's articulated thoughtful and compassionate opinions regarding a variety of issues.
Running as a Democrat in Texas can't be easy, but people respond to honesty.

Nor should he be ashamed.

This article is weirdly technical on a couple of levels.
Careful parsing of Twitter's rules is not a subject which entices most nor is it a matter for the faint of heart.

I heartily disagree with the vast majority of George Will's political viewpoints and general world view.
But I absolutely love the way that the man writes.
He's comically patrician and obsessed with diction (like, to a absurd degree), and I just eat it up.
And how could I possibly resist a scathing opprobrium of the obsequious cad, Mike Pence?
