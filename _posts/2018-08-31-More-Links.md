Isn't Kate McKinnon just a national treasure?

I had a shower thought recently.
I realized that I'm the an exceptionally efficient hipster.

I've kinda tried to reject the label of hipster if only because it's rather repugnant to me.
Simply calling myself a contrarian was good enough for me, although in hindsight it seems that contrarianism was simply a result of my hipster nature.

But back to the efficiency thing.
Hipsters as a group dismiss the most recent or most popular thing and prefer the old or unknown thing.[^a]
I do this, but I also make a mental bookmark of the thing and then go back to it when everybody stops talking about it.
Thus, my acquisition of

Michael Baumann tweeted[^1] that there may have been better presidents than Jimmy Carter, but we probably have not had a better man as president than Jimmy Carter.

In this article, we glean the origins of Carter's success as a public servant, but also his failure as a politician.
While it is certainly heartwarming and admirable to have a good person (whatever that actually means) as the president, the job requires a degree of cutthroat decisiveness not found within President Carter.

Disturbingly relevant, this piece comes to mind any time I think about or discuss the origins of Trump and the mindset of his base.

Just a whole lot of fun.
The other articles linked here are mostly downers, so I thought it'd be nice to have at least one that doesn't have depressing ramifications for the future of this country.

This article is a bit long, but super interesting/thought provoking.
And also not a little bit scary.
As one may infer from the title, there is a [part 2](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html).

The points brought up here are intriguing, this article is illustrative of the problems I have with the "tech" community as a whole.
Subordinating all (most dangerously morality) to "rationality" and the advancement of technology as an unquestionable goal and undeniable good is terrifying.
Societal and class related consequences need to be discussed, and it's a topic that tech writers tend to shy away from or are just ignorant of entirely.

I don't want to live in the glitzy technocracy for which these people seem to yearn.

I often worry that I might make the same mistake that prominent social media companies (read: Twitter and Facebook) have, quite publicly, made and subsequently fumbled the response.
It is the same trap into which many a public liberal have fallen: the overcorrection of one's biases.
The aforementioned tech companies were founded and are generally staffed by people (white dudes, we can be honest here) who would likely identify as falling somewhere on the left of the political spectrum.[^2]
In attempting to preemptively ward off accusations of liberal bias, they tend to show disproportionate deference to conservative ideas, often resulting in a net rightward lean.

That wasn't directly related to the article, just something that's been weighing on me.

Anyways, great article, good read on the pretty long history of American conservatism being gross and racist.

[^2]: I mean, they would say that, but in reality the ideology a lot of those people espouse is this bizarre hybrid of Blue Dog Democrat and Ayn Rand level libertarianism. It's a frustrating confluence of general naivet√© and social blinders.
