title: "The Film Crit Hulk Post."

There are so many articles that I could link here.[^1]
Like the at least three articles that Hulk wrote on __Speed Racer__, or the fascinating Wakaliwood piece, or the __Nightcrawler__ article on character arcs, or the Jonathan Gold eulogy; I really could go on and on.
Because of the surfeit of candidates, I decided to ignore my unwritten/unspoken rule of five; this post includes six links.

The oppressors[^5] are the only group in an oppressive system with the actual capacity to effect change; slaves could not emancipate themselves and women could not grant suffrage to themselves.
But in order for change to be effected, those who benefit from the system, who are often blind to its (the system's) existence, must take care to heed the outcry, to accept that their reality is not universal.

I mentioned this article in a previous post, but it's so gosh dang good that I couldn't resist linking it here.

Articulated in this article are, _inter alia_, the feelings that I have regarding things[^2] that I have liked by myself in the past, but are now generally accepted and lauded.
Obviously, the "thing" in this instance is __Star Wars__ and its legion of entitled, maladjusted, incel-lite,[^3] man-baby fanboys[^4].

[^1]: And desperately want to, but for the sake of the readers, and my own, I will desist.
[^2]: Films, video games, TV shows, media generally.
[^3]: If you don't know what an incel is, first off, lucky you, and to get up to speed on what that means, read [this _Vox_ article](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/25/17277496/incel-toronto-attack-alek-minassian) and/or watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gX0spJpa0), and prepare to be horrified and disgusted.
[^4]: This might be a tad harsh, but a lot of their commentary and criticisms of __The Last Jedi__ sounds disturbingly close to what incels say about the world generally.
[^5]: By which I mean white people and males, who are, if not actively oppressing, at least the beneficiaries of an oppresive system.
