LeBron James is awesome.
I mean that not only in the common, modern sense of the word,[^1] but also in the more literal sense, I am filled with awe.

I've undoubtedly talked many ears off regarding the Film Crit Hulk.

This is an article that was linked to in a Film Crit Hulk[^2] article[^3] with the title ["What We Talk About When We Talk About Female Filmmaking."](https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/03/16/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-female-filmmaking/)
Hulk write about how watching movies from a "logical" perspective really just pushes conversation into a raging vortex of systemic sexism.
The now infamous Google memo[^4] is shown as illustrative of how a relatively logical train of thought can, with the help of fear and some questionable leaps, lead to some horrific places.

This article articulates a unfortunate (also, unjust) phenomenon that I think I probably knew instinctively, but never put into words.
Loofbourow cites a comment from Mark Twain on __Pride and Prejudice__ where he completely misses the point (and artistry) of the book and he seems to dismiss, out of hand, the possibility of some deeper meaning or intent by Jane Austen.

Shea[^5] is one of my favorite writers; he is hilarious and unorthodox, and normally writes about subjects which are, to put it charitably, less than vital.
But within many of his articles, as can be seen with all great writers,[^6] a glimpse of their insight to humanity and their feelings on the human condition as a whole.
With this article that glimpse is much closer to the surface, as we witness the sheer _pathos_ of a man trying desperately to help those just like him find acceptance in the only country they have ever called home.

See [Dwight vs. Everything](https://theringer.com/tv/2018/8/3/17639830/conference-room-five-minutes-excerpt-shea-serrano-dwight-schrute-the-office) for a bit more levity, but, you know, less importance.

Pretty much just a real downer throughout.

[^1]: As in "__Avengers: Infinity War__ was awesome!"
[^2]: Here I go, talking your ear off again.
[^3]: An article which, incidentally, contains some great points about "left brain" filmmaking which really resonated with my general antipathy towards the "scourge" of rationality.
[^4]: I read the memo because of this article and I really wanted to punch my computer in the face and then burn the house down, it's really that bad. The complete and utter lack of self-awareness and just like, general knowledge and intelligence, is somehow shocking, utterly unsurprising, and infuriating.
[^5]: That's Mr. Serrano to you.
[^6]: And make no mistake, I count Shea Serrano among the great contemporary writers.
