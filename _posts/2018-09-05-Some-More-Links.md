I meant to rewrite some of the synopses below,[^a] but I didn't quite have the time/will power to do so.
So some of the paragraphs below contain half-baked thoughts and/or trains of thought that kinda just go nowhere.

{% include link.html title="LeBron James' greatest weapon is his brain" link="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain" author="Brian Windhorst" %}
LeBron James is awesome.
I mean that not only in the common, modern sense of the word,[^1] but also in the more literal sense, I am filled with awe.
Awe at the sheer level of athletic ability, but also his ability to parlay his success into help for the community in which he grew up.

{% include link.html title="Black Panther's Right Thing" link="https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/02/17/black-panthers-right-thing/" author = "Film Crit Hulk" %}
I've undoubtedly talked many ears off regarding the Film Crit Hulk; he's my favorite film/media commentator, and he just happens to have co-oped the Incredible Hulk as a _nom de plume_.
I feel like he's become a bit more accessible since he stopped writing in all caps, a practice which set a pretty high bar in terms of buy in.

Anyways, because of Hulk (at least partially), I watched __Speed Racer__ for the first time after he wrote something about how it is a legit masterpiece.
He has a lot to say about movies and pop culture generally, he's a huge fan of sincerity in media; sometimes cheesiness is what we need and embracing emotions can do a lot of good.
I could really go on and on about the ways that this author has changed the way I watch movies, think about the world, and live my life generally, but then I wouldn't really have anything to write about in future posts.

{% include link.html title="The Male Glance" link="https://www.vqronline.org/essays-articles/2018/03/male-glance" author = "Lili Loofbourow" %}
This is an article that was linked to in a Film Crit Hulk[^2] article[^3] with the title ["What We Talk About When We Talk About Female Filmmaking."](https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/03/16/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-female-filmmaking/)
Hulk write about how watching movies from a "logical" perspective really just pushes conversation into a raging vortex of systemic sexism.
The now infamous Google memo[^4] is shown as illustrative of how a relatively logical train of thought can, with the help of fear and some questionable leaps, lead to some horrific places.

This article articulates a unfortunate (also, unjust) phenomenon that I think I probably knew instinctively, but never put into words.
Loofbourow cites a comment from Mark Twain on __Pride and Prejudice__ where he completely misses the point (and artistry) of the book and he seems to dismiss, out of hand, the possibility of some deeper meaning or intent by Jane Austen.

This article, and those like it, strike a certain kind of fear into me.
It's not the fear of "losing power," I'm perfectly happy to cede my ill-gotten power, though I'm sure that I show some level of subconscious desire to hold onto it.
No, the fear is that I'm Mark Twain, that I'm those professors who didn't get the joke, or at just as ignorant; I fear this mindless oppression so insidious as to be unknown even to the oppressor.
One might respond that the simple fact of this fear is evidence enough that I'm not them, but then, should my fear escape me?
Leaving me open to the fact that I am them?
And the fear returns.

I have no satisfactory or real resolution to this...

Shea[^5] is one of my favorite writers; he is hilarious and unorthodox, and normally writes about subjects which are, to put it charitably, less than vital.
But within many of his articles, as can be seen with all great writers,[^6] a glimpse of their insight to humanity and their feelings on the human condition as a whole.
With this article that glimpse is much closer to the surface, as we witness the sheer _pathos_ of a man trying desperately to help those just like him find acceptance in the only country they have ever called home.

See [Dwight vs. Everything](https://theringer.com/tv/2018/8/3/17639830/conference-room-five-minutes-excerpt-shea-serrano-dwight-schrute-the-office) for a bit more levity, but, you know, less importance.

Pretty much just a real downer throughout.[^7]
Gaslighting is real.

Sometimes working in tech is just a real downer.

<hr class="footsep">

[^a]: And in some instances expand them.
[^1]: As in "__Avengers: Infinity War__ was awesome!"
[^2]: Here I go, talking your ear off again.
[^3]: An article which, incidentally, contains some great points about "left brain" filmmaking which really resonated with my general antipathy towards the "scourge" of rationality.
[^4]: I read the memo because of this article and I really wanted to punch my computer in the face and then burn the house down, it's really that bad. The complete and utter lack of self-awareness and just like, general knowledge and intelligence, is somehow shocking, utterly unsurprising, and infuriating.
[^5]: That's Mr. Serrano to you.
[^6]: And make no mistake, I count Shea Serrano among the great contemporary writers.
[^7]: At least until she quits and starts working at Stripe as the editor-in-chief of her own magazine.
