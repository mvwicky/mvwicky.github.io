## [LeBron James' greatest weapon is his brain](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain)
#### Brian Windhorst
LeBron James is awesome.
I mean that in the common, modern sense of the word,[^1] but also in the more literal sense, I am filled with awe.

## [Black Panther's Right Thing](https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/02/17/black-panthers-right-thing/)
#### Film Crit Hulk
I've undoubtedly talked many ears off regarding the Film Crit Hulk.

## [The Male Glance](https://www.vqronline.org/essays-articles/2018/03/male-glance)
#### Lili Loofbourow
This is an article that was linked to in a Film Crit Hulk article with the title ["What We Talk About When We Talk About Female Filmmaking."](https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/03/16/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-female-filmmaking/)

## [The Unwavering Resolve of an Undocumented Activist in the Age of Trump](https://www.theringer.com/2017/8/24/16194748/cesar-espinosa-immigration-interview)
#### Shea Serrano
Shea[^2] is one of my favorite writers; he is hilarious and unorthodox, and normally writes about subjects which are, to put it charitably, less than vital.
But within many of his articles, as can be seen with all great writers,[^3] a glimpse of their insight to humanity and their feelings on the human condition as a whole.
With this article that glimpse is much closer to the surface, as we witness the sheer _pathos_ of a man trying desperately to help those just like him find acceptance in the only country they have ever called home.

See [Dwight vs. Everything](https://theringer.com/tv/2018/8/3/17639830/conference-room-five-minutes-excerpt-shea-serrano-dwight-schrute-the-office) for a bit more levity, but, you know, less importance.

## [Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)
#### Susan Fowler
Pretty much just a real downer throughout.

[^1]: As in "__Avengers: Infinity War__ was awesome!"
[^2]: That's Mr. Serrano to you.
[^3]: And make no mistake, I count Shea Serrano among the great contemporary writers.
