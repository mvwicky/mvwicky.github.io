I've been thinking about something I head Pete Buttigieg say.[^6]
It was in an interview on _Pod Save America_ and he was talking about how Democrats could regain the midwest/white working class vote.
This topic is litigated with some frequency and is pretty problematic seeing as there are a ton of non-white working class people that are constantly overlooked, but he made what I see as a broader point.
He invoked a concept that gets bandied about by people who discuss this issue: the concept of "not talking down to them."

He gave an example: a liberal lawyer[^4] goes up to a Republican voting midwesterner, and complains that the midwesterner is voting against their own interest.
This is another point that gets brought up when trying to crack the white code; how could _these people_ act so illogically?
The midwesterner replies to the lawyer: "Well so are you."
Anyways, I thought that his little anecdote was a good illustration of the potential for condescension and paternalism that can come with being a liberal.

I have stayed at many a Marriott hotel.
But compared to these people, I have never even seen a Marriott.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.pedantic %}
I'm using this as a prop to reiterate an annoyance I have with the scientific community (and academic community writ large, I guess).
My annoyance is essentially the thesis of this article, that oftentimes, academic types[^1] focus too much on being "_correct_," as opposed to "_right_," or, like "_making a cogent/coherent/convincing argument_."
And I know that I am not innocent in all this, I have been a pedant in my life.

The most recognizable microcosm of this phenomenon about which I rant and rave is the "well actually" guy.
It's ignoring, intentionally or not, the broader point for the satisfaction of being able to point out a technical problem with an argument.
And all this is not to say that being technically correct is _per se_ pointless.[^2]
But it shouldn't be the entire point of an argument.
If the fulcrum of a debate or of an argument is a technical point, then the parties can just look it up and the debate will be settled; philosophical and moral disagreements are not settled so easily.

I read this dude's book.[^3]
Antitrust laws should be enforced more rigorously.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.fox %}
The lack of surprise that I felt upon reading this article was probably the most disturbing part of it.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.staceyabrams %}
Yay Stacey Abrams.

{% include objlink.html obj=page.links.mossad %}
Unlink the Fox News article, this one had me kinda freaking out.
And it's one thing to interfere in a high profile national election, but to screw around in such a specific election seems almost sociopathic.[^5]

[^1]: I'm including myself in that group, even though I am not currently in academia.
[^2]: Again, relating this to my engineering education, I tend to get annoyed when efficiency is used as the ultimate benchmark for efficacy, but efficiency is, obviously, not in and of itself a vice. And a lot of the time efficiency is measured narrowly, i.e., in terms of dollars and/or time (the two are equivalent in a capitalist society). To take a contemporary example, A.I. is an efficient tool for classifying data, e.g., finding hate speech on Facebook or identifying obscenity on YouTube; there are great fiscal gains in not having to pay human beings to do things. But the built in biases to such a system are inefficient in a much different way.
[^3]: [The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRLQSLG/). Basically a pamphlet, just 150 pages.
[^4]: I'm pretty sure lawyer was essentially a stand in for "person of means."
[^5]: Not that it's okay to screw around in a higher profile election.
[^6]: Yes, I did have to look up how to spell his name.
