The title does not refer to actual Columbus Day, like the 'holiday.'
I'm referring to the fact that I'm spending the day in Columbus, Indiana.
Arriving yesterday, I felt that the couple hours spent walking around were not enough for me to digest this place entirely.
I booked a hotel room (at a somewhat nicer place) for a second day in this place.

Why did I decide to make the only city (so far) that I stay in for two days a random midwest town of less that 50,000?
Look no further than the beautiful movie [`Columbus`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5990474/), directed by Kogonada, starring [John Cho](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158626/) and [Haley Lu Richardson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4726634/).
It's wonderful, beautifully shot, the word `elegant` is most apt, a minimum of moving shots, the most notable being a long dolly shot framing a conversation between the leads.
(That shot is, to me, such a good example of motivated camera movement, it's just great and must have been a huge pain to film.)

I think I've said, on a bevy of occasions that it is the movie which contains the most shots which I would like to have framed as pictures.

Tempering expectations is a good way to avoid disappointment, so I went in with fairly low expectations.
So far, my expectations have been exceeded.
I don't really know how to describe it, but I really like this place.

Sad for the last day here, but excited for a baseball game, hopefully in Milwaukee.

Now for a pretty hard detour...

## Some Random Election Commentary

I feel like so much of the rhetoric around the 2016 election was how liberal intellectuals don't understand 'real' America.
This type of place is what I feel like they were talking about.
Like, this isn't a typical midwest city, but this county voted like 64% for Trump.

What is so different about these people, or what is so different about me that I don't understand?
