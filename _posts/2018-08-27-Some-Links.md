A list of articles (technically links to articles) that I found interesting.
- [Vintage John McCain: Dead at 81, He Was America's Senator, Not Arizona's](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/john-mccain-america-senator-arizona-obituary-10001670) __(Amy Silverman)__
    + I first came across this article with the note "if you're not into hagiography \[read this article on John McCain\]." It does a fine job showing McCain as a human being, not the deity that national media outlets have been presenting in the last few days. I'd say that it may be a bit biased towards showing some negative aspects of McCain, but Silverman doesn't go out of her way to bash and/or disrespect McCain needlessly (plus, with the level of public adulation/canonization going on, it's fine to have the other side as well).
- [Beto O'Rourke Could Be The Democrat Texas Has Been Waiting For](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-texas-senate-midterms) __(Anne Helen Petersen)__
    + I'll admit from the outset that I'm not a little obsessed with Beto O'Rourke. He, like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, seems to be the rare politician that is comfortable also being a human being. [His response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAw9eXXVwfM) to a question regarding the NFL kneelers has really catapulted him into the limelight, but since the beginning of his campaign he's articulated thoughtful and compassionate opinions regarding a variety of issues. Running as a Democrat in Texas can't be easy, but people respond to honesty.
- [My name is Wil Wheaton. I Live With Chronic Depression and Generalized Anxiety. I Am Not Ashamed.](https://medium.com/@wilw/my-name-is-wil-wheaton-i-live-with-chronic-depression-and-generalized-anxiety-i-am-not-ashamed-8f693f9c0af1) __(Wil Wheaton)__
    + Nor should he be ashamed.
- [Twitter is wrong: facts are not enough to combat Alex Jones](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/8/10/17675232/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey-free-speech) __(Laura Hudson)__
    + This article is weirdly technical on a couple of levels.
- [Trump is no longer the worst person in government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-no-longer-the-worst-person-in-government/2018/05/09/10e59eba-52f1-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?utm_term=.91d64acd2727) __(George Will)__
    + I heartily disagree with the vast majority of George Will's political viewpoints and general world view. But I absolutely love the way that the man writes. He's comically patrician and obsessed with diction (like, to a absurd degree), and I just eat it up. And how could I possibly resist a scathing opprobrium of the obsequious cad, Mike Pence?
