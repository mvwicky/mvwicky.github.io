            This is a blog that I started as a place to record some thoughts, ideas, stories, baseball musings, and basically any other things that come to mind that I feel compelled to share.  <br> 
            <br>
            Baseball, it is one of my most intense passions, which is why it has a section dedicated to it. I grew up a Los Angeles Dodgers fan, and as I have gotten older my love of both the Dodgers and the game itself has grown exponentially. With this expansion of my, now, obsession with the game, I have become engrossed with statistics and Sabermetric analysis of players. The articles that I post about baseball will be on all topics of the game from its most emotional aspects to its most cold number crunching side.<br>
            <br>
            The stories section is dedicated to any narrative content that I happen to come up with and feel is worthy of sharing. I have a contentious relationship with writing as I love to do it but am often overcome with feelings of inadequacy and writer's block. When I do post, the formats will be varied. From treatments, to full on screenplays, to short stories, to the first (or any middle) chapter of a potential novel. <br>
            <br>
            Since this is an about page, I should probably write something about myself. I am twenty years old and a sophomore at Northeastern University. My major is Computer Engineering and I am an avid programmer, writer, and water polo player. Born in Santa Barbara, California, I grew a quarter mile from the beach and my life has been heavily shaped by my relationship with water. <br>
