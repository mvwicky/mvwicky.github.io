		<div id="articleTitle"><a>Anecdotal BABIP</a></div>
		<div id="articleDate">14 November 2014</div>
		<div id="articleContent">The best hitter on the team is at the plate, one out, runner on second. Pitcher winds up and delivers. A swing. The bat connects with force. It’s hit right on the screws, entered at 95 left at like 105. Pulled towards left, the ball, scalded, screams towards left. Right into the third baseman's glove. The runner barely gets back to first to avoid the double play. Next batter is no slouch himself, but he gets into a 1-2 count and makes a hasty protection swing. He rolls over the ball and it’s just a little dribbler. It manages to get past the pitcher and goes just into center field. The runner advances and it’s ruled a single. <br>That’s BABIP. Sometimes balls in play go for hits and sometimes they don’t. A hitter’s BABIP determined partially by luck and partially by skill level. Obviously, if that first hitter continues to scald line drives, they’ll go for hits more often than if the second batter keeps on hitting little dribblers. Speedier players, or those with a tendency towards liners will be able to float higher BABIPs. In general a hitter’s BABIP will fluctuate around his career average. A higher BABIP generally indicates that a hitter’s average should decrease and vice versa</div>
