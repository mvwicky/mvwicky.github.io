      I feel like I've been reading a lot about the America's Middle East policy lately.
      Spoiler alert: it has been quite a disaster for quite a while.

      We (by which I mean I) tend to think of Iraq as a singularly huge foreign policy blunder.
      While not exactly inaccurate, that formulation belies that fact that it was the culmination of decades of pretty terrible foreign policy decisions.

      It's striking how obvious historical parallels can be.
      In 1968, there was a contingent on the left that was all in on Gene McCarthy.
      They were drawn to his liberalism; the fact that he didn't act like a "normal" polictican only deepened their devotion.
