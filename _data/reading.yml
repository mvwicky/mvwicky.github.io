      I feel like I've been reading a lot about the America's middle east policy lately.
      Spoiler alert: it has been quite a disaster for quite a while.

      We tend to think of Iraq as a singularly huge foreign policy blunder.
      While not exactly inaccurate, that formulation belies that fact that it was the culmination of decades of not great foreign policy.
