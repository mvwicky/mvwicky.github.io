      I feel like I've been reading a lot about the America's Middle East policy lately.
      Spoiler alert: it has been quite a disaster for quite a while.

      We (by which I mean I) tend to think of Iraq as a singularly huge foreign policy blunder.
      While not exactly inaccurate, that formulation belies that fact that it was the culmination of decades of pretty terrible foreign policy decisions.

      Just another entry in my list of reasons why monarchy and the hereditary succession of power generally is dumb.
