Recently, I finished reading _War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Democracy_ by Ronan Farrow.

The first thing that I noticed about the book, well, it was before I started reading it, was Farrow's insane level of gosh darn productivity.
Like, he's pumping out articles on horrific sexual monsters and Israeli spies contracted to harass people, _inter alia_, and he apparently has the time to also write a book?
This ain't a short book either, a good 400-ish pages, spanning basically the entire globe, thirty-odd years, and involved interviews of every living Secretary of State.
Anyways, onto the substance of the thing.
