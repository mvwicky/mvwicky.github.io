I've come to a weird realization.
It came to me, or I thought of it, as a result of my starting to work, like at a job, again.
While I can partially attribute this feeling to general social awkwardness, there's a deeper problem here.

I can speak, fairly eloquently,[^1] on a couple topics in the social realm,[^2] but I cannot really speak fluently or particularly intelligently on work related topics, i.e., computer science and programming.
It's not even just that I can't speak off the cuff about CS, even after some level of thought and consideration I don't feel comfortable as an intellectual interlocutor, [^3] w.r.t.---<i>inter alia</i>---programming.

Looking back, I

[^1]: If I can flatter myself.

[^2]:
    What follow may prove to be a direct contradiction to a [previous footnote](#fn:1), here's an example of me extemporizing about something that is not a part of my life in any way, shape, or form.
    (You're really just gonna have to take my word on the whole time frame thing here; I promise that I wrote this in a timely, moderately unconsidered manner.)

    During the Enlightenment, i.e., the precipitating event of modernism, we kinda realized that all the major institutions (the church) were basically all just a bunch of bs.
    Modernism was a response to the general---among the intellectual elite---realization that we had been worshiping and venerating these patently false constructions.
    But, the minds of the era still viewed such institutions as an _a priori_ necessity, we were just using the wrong ones.
    This is the source of the sincerity/solemnity of most Modern creations; its creators were, in their minds, creating the new Church or the new monarchy, things that were important to the society and to the individual.[^4]

    Later on in, like, the 20<sup>th</sup> century, concomitant with developments in science, we realized that not only were those old institutions made up, but everything was made up.
    Astronomy showed us how insignificant we were against the awesome majesty of the universe.
    Biology and chemistry showed us the random chance that led to our development.
    In a way, this was the apotheosis of Modernism, the toppling of the ultimate myth: that humans are special and that life matters; Postmodernism was born.

    Anyways, that's the cliff notes version of Postmodernism's ironic nihilism.

[^3]: Yes, I did restructure that sentence so I could fit in that alliteration.
[^4]:
    Obviously I'm glossing over a ton for brevity, but it's likely that there was some recognition, from the intellectuals behind the movement, of such institutions' capacity for social control---for keeping the plebs in line.
    While I'm guessing a decent proportion among these elites truly believed in Modernism's righteousness, the art stemming from it was seen, essentially universally, as by and for those elites.
