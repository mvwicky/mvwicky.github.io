title: "Text Versus Texture"

Film Crit Hulk is the pen name of an impressively incisive film commentator (columnist?) who has a knack for expressing, clearly, thoughts that I have regarding film.
[His latest column](http://observer.com/2018/05/the-two-crucial-filmmaking-elements-causing-all-your-movie-feuds/) has really got me thinking.

The gist of the piece is that there are two ways to convey emotion in film: one via what happens (text) and one via the general feeling (texture).
Like he has done so many times before (see, e.g., [this](https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/07/17/film-crit-hulk-smash-kingsman-and-the-maybe-genius-of-non-winking-satire) article on _Kingsman_) he explains how I feel.
