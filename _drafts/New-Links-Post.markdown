There are times[^1] that I really have nothing to say about the things that I post.
It's sometimes that I think the piece speaks for itself and/or it aligns with my own views so well that anything I would say would be redundant.
In other instances, the lack of a satisfying onomatopoeia for screaming makes it impossible for me to say anything.

I feel somewhat confident saying that this piece will be viewed by posterity as one of the definitive deconstructions of the Trump era[^2].
Adam Serwer does a great job of breaking down the irrationality that underpins a lot of Trump's support.
Like, showing these people pictures of kids in cages and families being torn apart isn't exactly an effective rhetorical strategy in this instance.
They know that they're supporting policies that do this kind of inhumane shit to human beings; it isn't a regretful byproduct of some larger project, it is the project.

This is one of the screaming ones.

[^1]: It's most of the time to be honest.

[^2]: But what do I really know.
      What happens between now and the time where people look back at this time is fundamentally unknowable, which is always true, but seems more true now than at any other point in modern history.
      So, like something completely random and overlooked from this time period could turn out to be the more definitive or the definitive piece hasn't been written yet or life on earth will have ended.

      I guess somewhat confident may have been a bit of an overstatement.
