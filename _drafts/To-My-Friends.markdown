I used to tell people, truthfully, that I couldn't remember the last time I had been truly happy.

Instead I created a simulation of happiness, a smiling facade over anguish.

All too often I ignored, or chose to be ignored by, those who would look upon my true face unflinching.

Not with strained eyes of pity, nor cold eyes of disdain, but with warmth and compassion and empathy.

Only once I learned to simply open the door to those knocking, who wished only the simple pleasure of my company, did I experience true happiness.

_It is you all, who lent me strength when I was weak, courage when I was afraid, a smile when all I wanted to do was cry._

_For so much that I have, my life, my joy, I thank all of you._
