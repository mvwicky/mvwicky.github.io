After graduating college, I went on a cross-country road trip.
It was the second time that I'd done this, but this time was much, much different from the first.

The first time, I was racing across the country, I needed my car in Boston, the trip took four days.
Obviously, this resulted in long days and little sightseeing; the longest day of driving, I think, ended up being 14 hours.
This puts strain on the human body.
By the end I felt a little insane and a lot tired.

I resolved, I think before I started, that the next time this happened I would take my time, see some sights.
(TBH, the idea for this trip may have been in the works since, like, high school.)

Anyways, I planned a trip that featured the following stops:
1. Burlington, Vermont
2. Ithaca, New York
3. Detroit, Michigan
4. Columbus, Indiana
5. Chicago, Illinois
6. Milwaukee, Wisconsin
7. Minneapolis, Minnesota
8. Fargo, North Dakota
9. Theodore Roosevelt National Park
10. Yellowstone National Park
11. Salt Lake City, Utah
12. Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument
13. Great Basin National Park
14. Death Valley National Park

I started in Boston; the last stop was home, Santa Barbara.

Before the trip, I had to pack up and move out of 269 Highland. 

## May 16: Boston to Burlington
This leg was ... eventful, to say the least.
Well, it technically was pretty uneventful until the very end, at which point it was more of a pain in the ass.

Starting out, I had to ship two packages and pack up my car.
Said packing was stressful b/c I couldn't find street parking close to my house so I had to run up and down the street like twenty times to put all my stuff in the car.
Every single time I ran (well, I fast walked, cause a lot of my stuff is pretty heavy) I expected to see that puddle of shattered glass next to my car, luckily, this never happened.

Finally getting into the car and driving felt like a miracle; I was very sweaty.

I proceeded to drive 350-ish miles to Burlington without major incident.
Registering a faint surprise at the lack of problems driving that distance in a car which had gone without use for like, basically a year straight, I braked at a stop light and heard a troubling noise.

It was a groaning sound, accompanied by a popping; once the light turned green, I felt weird resistance.
Immediately I pulled over and had a mini freakout.
Having recovered sufficiently, I looked up mechanics in Burlington and found one like a half mile away.

In an attempt to wrap this part up, I'll just say that I walked a lot over the next twelve to eighteen hours.
